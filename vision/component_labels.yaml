# Component labels for Lawkhai Aerovision visual annotations.
#
# These labels are intentionally generic and training-focused.
# They describe major system components conceptually, not
# maintenance actions or procedures.
#
# This file can be used by both:
# - Static image / video annotation tools.
# - Optional YOLO-based detectors (Phase 1.5 / 2).
